# CAPTCHA Solver UI DemonstrationThis project provides a simple, responsive web interface for a CAPTCHA input and validation system. It uses HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side logic.## Features- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.- **Dynamic Image Loading**: Loads CAPTCHA images either from a default local file (`sample.png`) or from a URL provided as a query parameter.- **User Input Field**: Allows users to enter the CAPTCHA characters.- **Client-Side Validation**: Provides basic validation against a predefined CAPTCHA text for demonstration purposes.## Usage1.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.2.  **Default CAPTCHA**: By default, the application will display `sample.png` as the CAPTCHA image. The correct text to enter for this image is "ADCRS" (case-insensitive).3.  **Load Custom CAPTCHA**: To load a custom CAPTCHA image from a URL, append a `?url=` query parameter to your `index.html` URL.    Example: `file:///path/to/your/project/index.html?url=https://example.com/some_captcha_image.png`    *Note: For security reasons, browsers might block loading images from external HTTP/HTTPS URLs if the page is loaded via `file://` protocol. For best results with external URLs, serve the `index.html` file from a web server.*## Technologies Used- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsiveness.- **JavaScript**: Client-side logic for image loading and CAPTCHA validation.## CAPTCHA Validation LogicFor the purpose of this demonstration, the CAPTCHA validation is hardcoded to expect "ADCRS" (case-insensitive) as the correct answer. This allows for a functional demonstration of the input and validation process for the provided `sample.png`. It is important to note that this is a client-side only validation and does not involve actual OCR or server-side CAPTCHA solving.## Local Attachments- `sample.png`: The default CAPTCHA image displayed when no `url` parameter is provided.## ContributingFeel free to fork this repository or suggest improvements.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
